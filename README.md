# Predict_the_prices_using_Gradient_Boosting

In this project, our objective is to create a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm to estimate house prices in Boston. We'll be working with the Boston Housing Data, which contains multiple features related to housing and socioeconomic factors, with the target variable being the median value of owner-occupied homes.
